# modular-inventory-management-system

Overview

This project implements a modular, object-oriented system to manage items across multiple container types, including single-compartment, multi-compartment, and specialised container configurations.

The system allows users to interactively manage inventory, organise storage structures, and simulate hierarchical storage behaviour through scalable and reusable components.

----Key Features
Object-oriented design using classes and inheritance
Support for multiple container types and compartment structures
Interactive command-based user interface
Modular and extensible system architecture
Validation logic to ensure consistent storage rules

---- Technical Concepts Applied
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Abstraction and encapsulation
Inheritance and polymorphism
Modular system design
Structured input validation

----- Technologies Used: Python

----- The system allows users to:
Create containers
Add items dynamically
Manage multi-compartment configurations
Simulate structured storage environments

----- Learning Outcomes:
This project strengthened my understanding of system modelling, modular architecture, and scalable software design.
